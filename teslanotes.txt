.nav__logo {
  display: flex;
  position: sticky;
  z-index: 2;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
}

position sticky keeps our element stick to its place when we scroll it also requires position like top right left 


2) 
flex: 1;
element will take maxium space it wants 

3)
visibility: hidden;

we used visibility: hidden because display hidden would make element left to it closer or move towards side bar
